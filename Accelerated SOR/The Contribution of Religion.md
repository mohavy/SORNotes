# The contribution of religion
Religion has contributed to individuals and society throughout human history through attempting to answer the fundamental questions of human existence, such as:
- Why am I here?
- Is there a supreme being?
- Why do evil and suffering exist?
- Is there life after death?

Religion helps to construct *meaning*, provides *ethical guidance* and provides a *sense of belonging*.
