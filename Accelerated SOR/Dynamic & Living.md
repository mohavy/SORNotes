# Dynamic & Living
A dynamic religion is one characterised by energy, ambition, new ideas and practical achievements. It develops into a powerful force that refreshes itself constantly, and therefore avoids settling into a predictable or conservative rut. A living religion is one that is full of life; it is practical, real and immersed in - not removed from or afreaid of - everyday human existence.
