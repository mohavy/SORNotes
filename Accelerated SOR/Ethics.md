# Ethics
Ethics can be understood as the explicit, philosophical and/or religious reflection on moral beliefs within a tradition. They are central to any religion.

Their purpose is to clarify what is right and wrong, and what the followers of a religion should freely do, or refrain from doing.
- E.g, the ethic love in Christinaity; Covenetal ethic in Judaism
- Law concerns what you must do and what will happen if you don't (rules and punishments). Examples: Shari'a (Law): pray 5 times daily, give alms, four wives... Torah ("law"): hundreds of laws, dietary (milk and meat).
