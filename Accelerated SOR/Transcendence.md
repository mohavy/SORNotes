# Trascendence
-    From the Latin “to surpass” or “go beyond”
    
-   The divine exists beyond or is independent of physical or human existence.
    
-   The transcendent dimension allows humans to move beyond their earthly concerns to the heavenly or spiritual matters.
    
-   For example: for Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the one God exists beyond the human, yet guides humanity throughout their daily existence.
    
-   Transcendence and [[Immanence]] are not mutually exclusive
    
-   God is the creator of the universe, omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent. This is God’s transcendence.
