# Answering a 5 marker
Start with "cubing the question":
- Circle the key term of the question
- Underline the content words of the questions
	- Look for stimulus language
- Box - identify if there are any limiting words ONE or teachings
- Explain - The question in your own words.

Tips:
- D = Define the main component of the question
- S = Syllabus, make the link to the specific section from the syllabus
- E = Example, use specific examples to support your answer
- L = Link to the question, concluding statement

5 Golden Rules of writing short answers:
1. Answer the question
2. Organise and order your information
3. Start with an opening sentence which answers the question directly and previews the main ideas
4. Provide specific examples and evidence
5. As a general rule sentences should be around 25 words. If sentences are too long there are too many ideas. One idea = one sentence.

Your job is to convince the marker of a certain idea, not explain it like they've never heard it of.

Remember:
- In your short answers make every word count
- There is no room for long introductions
- Be specific, provide facts not generalisations
- Use appropriate terminology
- Provide examples
- Know your directive terms i.e. describe, discuss, explain
- Even with short answers plan what you are going to write.
