# Immanence
-  From the Latin “to remain within”
    
-   The supernatural or divine is present, and remains within, all things in the natural/physical world.
    
-   An immanent world view refers to the ‘inner’ aspects of spirituality.
    
-   Emphasis is placed on God or gods in human existence in day to day life.
    
-   For example: in Buddhism and Hinduism, a divine being or powers dwell within the individual. In Buddhism, the ultimate goal is nirvana, which gives a sense of the ultimate meaning.
    
-   [[Transcendence]] & Immanence are not mutually exclusive.
    
-   Humans are made in God’s image, so some elements of the divine dwell within us. This is God’s immanence.
